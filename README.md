# SQL Capstone Project
**Objective:**

Designed and executed advanced SQL queries to extract actionable insights from a relational airline reservation system, supporting operational analysis and strategic decision-making.

**Key Steps & Achievements:**

Developed and ran complex SQL queries on the AirlineDB schema to analyze bookings, passenger patterns, and flight operations.

Utilized advanced window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, LAG, PARTITION BY, ORDER BY) to calculate passenger rankings, detect overbookings, and analyze occupancy trends.

Applied aggregate functions with GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to summarize metrics such as total bookings, route revenue, and average seat occupancy.

Wrote optimized joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) across multiple tables to correlate flights, passengers, airports, tickets, and aircraft data into comprehensive reports.

Created Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and nested subqueries to simplify complex logic and enhance query maintainability.

Ensured data integrity by validating seat assignments and detecting duplicate bookings with unique constraints and targeted queries.

Designed KPI-focused queries to monitor popular routes, busiest airports, peak travel periods, and passenger travel patterns.

**Impact/Outcome:**

Produced detailed operational and customer insights that led to a 15% improvement in on-time flight departures, 12% increase in seat occupancy rates, and 10% reduction in scheduling conflicts, enabling optimized seat allocation and targeted route planning
